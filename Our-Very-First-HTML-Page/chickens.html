  Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia,
  Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[6] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe,
  the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. From
  ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to
  Greece by the 5th century BC.[7] Fowl have been known in Egypt since the
  mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come
  from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of
  Thutmose III.
